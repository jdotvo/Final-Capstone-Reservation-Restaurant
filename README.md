1. After setting up your database instances, connect DBeaver to your new database instances by following the instructions in the "PostgreSQL: Installing DBeaver" checkpoint.

### Knex

Run `npx knex` commands from within the `back-end` folder, which is where the `knexfile.js` file is located.

## Installation

1. Run `cp ./back-end/.env.sample ./back-end/.env`.
1. Update the `./back-end/.env` file with the connection URL's to your ElephantSQL database instance.
1. Run `cp ./front-end/.env.sample ./front-end/.env`.
1. You should not need to make changes to the `./front-end/.env` file unless you want to connect to a backend at a location other than `http://localhost:5001`.
1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm run start:dev` to start your server in development mode.

If you have trouble getting the server to run, reach out for assistance.

## Running tests
